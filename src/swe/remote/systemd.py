"""Run the hub as a systemd user service on Linux, so it outlives a reboot.

The Linux twin of ``launchd.py``: ``swe remote serve --install`` writes
``~/.config/systemd/user/swe-remote-hub.service``, enables it and
(re)starts it; ``swe remote agent --install`` does the same for the
satellite under ``swe-remote-agent.service``. Hubs before the
quiver -> swe rename installed ``quiver-remote-*.service``: install and
uninstall stop, disable and remove that unit too (``old_unit``), the
way ``launchd.py`` clears ``OLD_LABEL``. ``Restart=always`` brings the hub back when it exits,
which is also how a ``--tailnet`` hub waits for Tailscale at boot: it
exits until the tailnet address exists.

A user service stops when its user logs out unless lingering is on, so
a home server would lose its hub with the last SSH session. ``install``
turns lingering on when the system lets a user do that for themself
(polkit usually does), and says so when it needs ``sudo``.

Logic only: callers print. ``run`` is injectable so tests never touch
the real systemctl.
